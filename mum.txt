1Use the following command to generate a new SSH key:
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
      Make sure to replace your_email@example.com with the email address associated with your GitHub account.
3. You will be prompted to choose a location to save the key. Press Enter to save it in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
4. You can optionally set a passphrase for added security.
5. Once the key is generated, you can display it using the command:
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   6. Copy the SSH key from the terminal.
7. Go to your GitHub account settings, navigate to SSH and GPG keys, and click on "New SSH key."
8. Paste the copied SSH key into the "Key" field and give it a title.
9. Click on "Add SSH key."

You have now successfully generated an SSH key and added it to your GitHub account for authentication.
